# Elevator System Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-elevator system for a 10-floor building with 5 elevators. The system manages elevator calls, movement, and user interactions through a modern web interface.

## System Requirements

### Building Configuration
- 10 floors (including ground floor)
- 5 elevators
- Call buttons on each floor

### Core Features
1. **Floor Call System**
   - Green call button on each floor
   - Button state changes (green → red → green)
   - Text states ("call" → "waiting" → "arrived" → "call")

2. **Elevator Management**
   - Smart elevator assignment (closest available)
   - Queue system for handling multiple calls
   - Smooth elevator movement animation
   - Time tracking for elevator arrival
   - Visual state indicators (color changes)
   - Sound notification on arrival

3. **Timing Requirements**
   - 2-second pause at destination floor
   - Smooth movement between floors
   - Accurate time measurement

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
1. **Building View**
   - Visual representation of 10 floors
   - 5 elevator shafts
   - Call buttons for each floor

2. **Elevator Component**
   - Position tracking
   - State management (color, movement)
   - Animation system

3. **Button Component**
   - State management
   - Visual feedback
   - Event handling

### Backend Logic
1. **Elevator Controller**
   - Elevator assignment algorithm
   - Queue management
   - Movement coordination

2. **State Management**
   - Elevator states (idle, moving, arrived)
   - Button states
   - Building state

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement basic building layout
3. Create elevator and button components

### Phase 2: Elevator Logic
1. Implement elevator movement system
2. Develop elevator assignment algorithm
3. Create queue management system

### Phase 3: User Interface
1. Implement button states and animations
2. Add elevator movement animations
3. Integrate sound notifications

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. Test elevator assignment logic
2. Verify timing requirements
3. Optimize performance

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- State Management: Redux
- Animation: CSS Transitions/Animations
- Sound: Web Audio API
- Testing: Jest/React Testing Library

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow component-based architecture
2. Implement responsive design
3. Ensure smooth animations
4. Maintain clean code structure
5. Document all major components

## Success Criteria
1. All elevators respond to calls efficiently
2. No missed calls or queue overflow
3. Smooth elevator movement
4. Accurate timing measurements
5. Proper state management
6. Responsive and intuitive UI

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement basic building layout
4. Develop elevator component
5. Create button component
6. Implement elevator controller logic
